A Custom Operating System

## What I am working on:
I have just implemented the PIT timer and am now moving onto the TSS and multitasking. Hopefully with user mode enabled, but we will see.

## Up Next:
 - Implementing syscalls will be vital for applications.
 - AHCI Driver
 - Filesystems and file managers
 - Desktops/GUI
